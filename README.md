# Customer Churn Prediction for a Telecom Company ðŸ“Š

## Introduction  
This project aims to predict customer churn for a telecom company using machine learning techniques. Customer churn, where customers stop using a service, is a critical problem in the telecom industry. By identifying at-risk customers, telecom companies can take proactive measures to improve retention and customer satisfaction.

---

## Project Goals  
- Analyze customer data to understand key factors influencing churn.  
- Develop, train, and evaluate various machine learning models to predict churn.  
- Deploy the best-performing model using **Streamlit** to provide a user-friendly web application for churn prediction.

---

## Dataset  
The dataset used in this project contains customer information such as:  
- **Demographic details**  
- **Service subscription details**  
- **Usage patterns**  
- **Payment methods**  
- **Churn status**  

**Key Features:**  
- **Rows and Columns:** Before preprocessing: 7043 rows and 21 columns| After preprocessing:7032 rows and 20 columns  
- **Target Variable:** `Churn` (Binary - 0: Non-churning, 1: Churning)

## Workflow  

### 1. Data Preprocessing  
- Handled missing values and outliers.  
- Encoded categorical variables using **LabelEncoder** and **One-Hot Encoding**.
- Scaled numerical features using **RobustScaler**.  

### 2. Exploratory Data Analysis  
- Visualized customer distribution across various features.  
- Analyzed correlations and feature importance.  

### 3. Machine Learning Models  
Trained and evaluated multiple models, including:  
- Logistic Regression  
- Random Forest 
- Support Vector Machine (SVC)  
- Voting Classifier  
- Decision Tree Classifier  
- K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)  

### 4. Model Evaluation  
- Used **F1-score** as the primary evaluation metric due to class imbalance.  
- Compared models using metrics like **ROC-AUC** and confusion matrices.  
- **Best-performing model:** Logistic Regression  

### 5. Deployment  
- Deployed the Logistic Regression model using **Streamlit**, providing an interactive web app for churn prediction.
